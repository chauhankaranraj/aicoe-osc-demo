    "As the second step of the pipeline, the notebook aims to take the extracted text from PDFs and annotated files to create the curated training set for the language model. The extracted text for this notebook is in the `ROOT/data/extraction` directory and the output csv dataset will be stored in `ROOT/data/curation` directory. The Curator class finds positive labels from annoated files and creates negative examples from the extracted text. The output dataset from this notebook will be used for the next step of the pipeline, i.e., training the model. "
